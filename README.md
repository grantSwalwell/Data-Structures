# Data-Structures
Code from Data Structures Spring 2016 and the following years (mostly after the class). Series of various algorithms and data structures in c++ header files. In the future I hope to add information about each algorithm.

    Bit Adjacency Matrix
    Adjacency List

# Hashing

    Abstract Hash Table - incomplete
  
# Heaps 

    Abstract Heap
