# Data-Structures
Code from Data Structures Spring 2017 and the following year. Series of various algorithms and data structures in c++ header files. In the future I hope to add information about each algorithm. 

Array - Class encapsulating a primitive c++ array

Graphs:
    Adjacency Matrix
    Bit Adjacency Matrix
    Adjacency List

Hashing: 

  Array Hash Table / Abstract Hash Table - incomplete
  
Heaps:

  Abstract Heap
  Min Heap
  Max Heap

Linked List - pointer implementation

Matrix - 2d array class

Queue:
  
  Array implementation 
  Circular Array implementation
  Linked List implementation
  
Searching:
  
  Binary Search
  Depth First Search
  Breadth First Search

Sorting:
  
  Bucket Sort
  Insertion Sort
  Selection Sort
  Radix Sort
  Heap Sort
  Merge Sort

Stack:
  
  Array Stack implementation 
  Linked List Stack implementation
  
String class - array implementation

Trees:
  
  Array Binary Search Tree
  Array Binary Tree
  AVL Tree
  Abstract Balance Tree
  Binary Search Tree 
  Binary Tree
  Red Black Tree - 90% working
  TreeVisualizer - boring
 
Vector - extends Array class
